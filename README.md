## Overview

[SkyCMS](https://Sky.moonrise.net/) is an open-source, cloud-native Content Management System designed for high-performance, scalability, and ease of use. Built with modern web technologies, SkyCMS runs in multiple modes to meet different deployment needs:

- **Static Mode**: All content hosted on a static website with automatic content refresh - highest performance, stability, and operational simplicity
- **Headless Mode**: Content delivered via API - ideal for multi-channel content distribution (web, mobile, desktop)
- **Decoupled Mode**: Content delivered via dedicated website - near-static performance with backend functionality

## üéØ Design Objectives

SkyCMS was built with the following core objectives:

- **Performance**: Outperform traditional CMSs in speed, capacity, and stability
- **User-Friendly**: Easy to use by both web developers and non-technical content editors
- **Low Maintenance**: Easy to administer with low operational costs
- **Flexible Deployment**: Support for static, decoupled, and headless modes
- **Cloud-Native**: Built for modern cloud infrastructure with global scalability

## üöÄ Use Cases

SkyCMS excels in demanding scenarios:

- **High-Capacity Websites**: Government sites during emergencies, news portals
- **Content-Heavy Platforms**: Media sites like New York Times, National Geographic, streaming platforms
- **Performance-Critical Applications**: Sites requiring minimal latency and efficient content delivery
- **Global Distribution**: Multi-regional redundancy with minimal administration overhead
- **Non-Technical Teams**: User-friendly interface requiring minimal training
